Machine learning project for predicting student placement status using global student migration data.

# Machine Learning Model Deployment using Streamlit

This repository contains the **deployment code** for a Machine Learning research project implemented using **Streamlit**.  
The application provides an interactive web interface for making predictions using a trained classification model.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The deployed application is based on a comparative machine learning study conducted on a **tabular dataset sourced from Kaggle**.  
Multiple classification models were evaluated during the research phase, and the **Random Forest classifier** was selected for deployment due to its robustness and strong performance.

This repository focuses **only on deployment**, while model training and experimentation were completed separately.

## 🧠 Model Information

- **Selected Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Reason for Selection:**  
  - Handles feature interactions effectively  
  - Performs well with overlapping class boundaries  
  - Provides stable and reliable predictions  

The trained model was saved and loaded using `joblib`.
